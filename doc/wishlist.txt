WISHLIST

#===CRUCIAL===#

-> top contributor for mined hypothesis analysis if Tinitial is collapsed x2

-> user i/p discretization and discretization algorithm

-> An analysis log like MetaboNexus'

-> play around with RF parameters

-> find classic use-cases and examples datasets

-> one unified example for SP, hypo analysis, difflift and contri

-> test speeds on the classic datasets

-> using googleVis or similiar API/packages to do interactive graphics

-> export contexted data

-> clean code
  $ make naming of variables, functions, modules more consistent
  $ @ for listing in comments for reactive stuff
  $ for non-reactive, update comments for Table()
  $ transfer part of the initialTest code into the reactive Test() module,
  $ might want to print some messages in the console

-> flowchart/UML

-> ship/deploy (gist, shinyapps.io, package)

#===OPTIONAL===#

-> min.sup for Tinitial

-> display support (implemented but no reactive yet)

-> imputation

-> option to exclude Acmp as predictor for context mining

-> alternative way to visualise SP in hypothesis analysis tab?

-> use MH-test to complement difflift and contribution (3-way tables)

-> alternative models for context mining (stepwise regression, NBC)?

-> Test diagnostics: if TD fails, non-parametric test and/or permutation test (exchangibility), with sequential hypothesis testing. also the 1-sum(p-values from stratified tests)

-> consider all pairwise context items combinations (put dl, pvalues in a matrix)

-> row.names

-> identification of outliers, removal of outliers from dataset

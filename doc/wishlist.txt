WISHLIST

-> Initial test: render contingency table for cont. Atgt, with chi squared test

-> Test diagnostics: navPanel(), t-test and chi-squared test as above

-> alternative way to visualise SP in hypothesis analysis tab?

-> alternative models for context mining (stepwise regression, NBC)?

-> exclude Acmp as predictor for context mining?

-> display RF VIP

-> difflift and contribution of the attributes as a whole, OR test

-> min.sup for Tinitial

-> consider all pairwise context items combinations (put dl, pvalues in a matrix)

-> top contributor for mined hypothesis analysis

-> display support (implemented but no reactive yet)

-> user i/p discretization and discretization algorithm

-> An analysis log like MetaboNexus'

-> find classic use-cases and examples datasets

-> one unified example for SP, hypo analysis, difflift and contri

-> test speeds on the classic datasets

-> using googleVis or similiar API/packages to do interactive graphics

-> export contexted data

-> clean code
  $ make naming of variables, functions, modules more consistent
  $ @ for listing in comments for reactive stuff
  $ for non-reactive, update comments for Table()
  $ transfer part of the initialTest code into the reactive Test() module,
  $ might want to print some messages in the console

-> flowchart/UML

-> ship/deploy (gist, shinyapps.io, package)
